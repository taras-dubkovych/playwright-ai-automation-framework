### Playwright AI Automation Framework (Work in Progress)

This project is a UI test automation framework using **TypeScript** and **Playwright**, with an additional **AI assistant** for:

- generating draft test cases from feature descriptions
- creating draft bug reports from failed test runs

The repository is currently in the early setup stage:
- TypeScript + Node.js project structure
- basic OOP examples (`User`, `UserService`, `Logger`)

Upcoming:
- Playwright setup with Page Object Model
- GitHub Actions CI
- AI assistant integration (test generator, bug report generator)
